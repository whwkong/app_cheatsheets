## Instructions

see <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4929251/can-you-step-through-python-code-to-help-debug-issues>

https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html

The typical usage to break into the debugger from a running program is to insert

	import pdb; pdb.set_trace()


## Common pdb commands

	b  		- set a breakpoint
	c		- continue debugging until you hit a breakpoint
    
	s		- step through code
    r       - return; continue to the end of the subroutine
    
	n		- next line
	l		- list source code (default : 11 lines)
	u		- navigate up a stack frame (step up)
	d		- navigate down a stack frame (step down)
	p		- print the value of an expression
    
    w(here) - Print a stack trace, with the most recent frame at the bottom.
    
    tbrea   - Temporary breakpoint, which is removed automatically when it is first hit.
